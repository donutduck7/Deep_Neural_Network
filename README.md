AlphabetSoup Charity Prediction Model

Overview:
The AlphabetSoup Charity Prediction Model is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the success of applicants for AlphabetSoup Charity organizations. AlphabetSoup Charity is a fictional organization that provides financial assistance to various groups and individuals. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can analyze past applicant data and determine the likelihood of success for new applicants. By identifying potential successful candidates, AlphabetSoup Charity can optimize their funding allocation and increase their impact.

Key Features:

Dataset: The project utilizes a dataset (charity_data.csv) containing information about past applicants, including application type, classification, income amount, organization type, and more.
Neural Network Model: A neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries to predict the success of applicants based on various features present in the dataset.
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and splitting into training and testing sets.
Model Training: The preprocessed data is used to train the neural network model, optimizing its parameters to achieve the best performance in predicting applicant success.
Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in predicting success accurately.
Model Deployment: Once trained and evaluated, the model can be deployed to make predictions on new applicant data, helping AlphabetSoup Charity identify potential successful applicants for funding.
Files Included:
Deep_neural_networks.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving.
charity_data.csv: Dataset used for training the model, containing information about past applicants.
